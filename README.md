# What is Rustified?
Rustified is a minecraft plugin that adds mechanics from the game of Rust. If you are familiar with Rust and how it works, understanding the functionalities of this
plugin will be very easy. There are several main mechanics that come with this plugin that being:

- Blue prints for all items
- Upkeep for bases and decay


These two mechanics alone add many different dimensions to the game, and more will be added once these two are complete.

### Blue prints
In Rust, you can craft items similar to minecraft. However, even if you have the proper items necessary to craft an item, you need to learn the blueprint for the item in order to craft it. To get a blueprint, you can either:

1. Research it from the item you managed to find without crafting.
2. Discover it with a workbench that takes iron and gives you a random blueprint

Think of blue prints as being another prerequisite that must be filled in order to craft an item. For example, if you wanted to craft a diamond sword, in addition to needing a stick and 2 diamonds you would also need to have learned *how* to make a sword by learning the blueprint for a diamond sword. Only then can you craft a diamond sword.

### Upkeep

In Rust, you can claim land to create a base very similar to how base claiming in Minecraft factions work. However, there is a thing called “Upkeep” in Rust, where you need to store certain items in a vault-like storage in order to maintain your base from falling apart.

Example: You build a base out of log. You need to store x amount of logs to stop your base from falling apart. This is a daily amount, so you'd need to keep filling this storage as it consumes the items necessary to "upkeep" your base.


## Contributing
If you wish to contribute to this project I greatly appreciate all commits. If you have played Rust before, then that will help tremendously with know how to program these mechanics. If not, smaller commits dealing with non-mechanical tasks are equally appreciated.
